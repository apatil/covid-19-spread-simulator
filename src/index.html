  <p>
    <b>How to use:</b> This is like the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/'>Washington Post COVID-19 simulator</a> but, in addition to watching the epidemic spread, you can fight it with interventions based on existing technologies that we can use in the next stage of our fight against COVID-19, before vaccines are widely available. 
    <br><br>
    You can ask a certain percentage of the people in the simulation to wear masks, N95 masks, or to simply wash hands 10 times or more per day. In the real world, please do not buy N95 or other medical-grade masks, or any other medical-grade personal protective equipment, until there is no longer a shortage.
    <br><br>
    You can also require ongoing social distancing. In this game, social distancing prevents a given percentage of interactions from happening at all. If things get out of hand, you can impose an emergency lockdown, forcing most people to stay at home.
    <br><br>
    You can also choose to test a certain percentage of people in the simulation for COVID-19 periodically. Anyone who tests positive will go into self-quarantine and will not infect anyone else until they recover.
    <br><br>
    Finally, because we still don't know the exact value of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number>R0</a> for COVID-19, you can choose a value. R0 is the average number of infections caused by a single primary infection. <a href=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/>Estimates</a> for COVID-19 typically range from 1.5 to 3.5; higher values make the virus harder to fight.
    <br><br><br>
    <b>The goal</b> Try to suppress the pandemic, so that not many people ever become infected. Also, try to 'flatten the curve' so that not too many individuals are infected at different times. If you can, try not to disrupt the economy too much with emergency lockdowns. We have to win the real-world version of this game, at least until vaccines become available. As noted in <a href=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf>Ferguson et al. (2020)</a>, allowing the virus to infect a large fraction of the population would likely lead to tremendous loss of life and overload of health systems.
    <br><br><br>
    <b>What should I take away from this?</b> Qualitative intuition about how mutiple interventions based on existing technology can work together to slow the spread of COVID-19, even if each intervention is not perfect.
    <br><br>
    In particular, interventions that are always under individuals' personal control, like handwashing and mask usage, add to the effectiveness of other interventions like testing and lockdowns. So, in addition to the other tools we use to fight the virus, we should all be diligent about handwashing and mask usage. These interventions have more of an effect if more people use them.
    <br><br><br>
    <b>What should I not take away from this?</b> This game does not make quantitative predictions about the real world. If you find that x% handwashing compliance and y% mask usage is sufficient to prevent the epidemic from spreading in the game, it doesn't mean that would be the case in the real world.
    <br><br>
    The simulated population is very different from a real population, and none of the parameters that went into this game are known with any precision for COVID-19 in any particular circumstances. 
    <br><br><br>
    <b>About the numbers</b> Effectiveness estimates for masks and handwashing more than ten times daily for SARS (not SARS-COV-2/COVID-19) were taken from <a href=https://www.bmj.com/content/336/7635/77.short>Jefferson et al. (2008)</a> whose main results were that "Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggests that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52); wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03); wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06); wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41); wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12); and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97)." 
    <br><br>
    To emphasize, these numbers should not be taken as predictive for COVID-19. They were measured for SARS, and also substantial variation was observed between constituent studies. However, they are encouraging.
    <br><br>
    The odds ratios reported were for the study period, not for each potentially infectious contact. Assuming one or more potentially infectious contacts occurred during each study period, the probability of prevention for each potentially infectious contact would be at least as high as the probability of prevention over the entire study period, since avoiding infection for a study period requires avoiding infection at each contact. Correcting these underestimates would require some (more) modeling assumptions, and for purposes of this game I prefer to err on the side of not encouraging inflated hopes about the effectiveness of interventions.
